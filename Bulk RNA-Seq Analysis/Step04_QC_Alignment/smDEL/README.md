**RSeQC analysis for smDEL alignments.**
- Step 4.1 - Create indexed .bam files (.bai)
- Step 4.2 - Run RSeQC. (This can take a while to run; plan accordingly.)

*This was performed for both STAR & HISAT2 alignments. Code from one representative script is shown. Outputs can be found in ../Outputs/.*

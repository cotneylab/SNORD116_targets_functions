**Step by step bulk RNA-seq analysis pipeline.** \
*Note: There are differences between smDEL and lgDEL scripts, not out of necessity, but rather because I developed as a coder. The lgDEL processing pipeline is a much more high-throughput way of processing data, but either style will work. The options used for each program/tool are uniform across sample sets.*

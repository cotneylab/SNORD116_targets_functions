Gene identifiers (ENSEMBL IDâ€™s) were used to determine which genes were shared across deletion datasets.
Analysis was also performed comparing the DEGs from the smDEL lines to the DEGs described in the *Snord116* deletion mouse (PMID: ####).
Other analyses performed on list of 42 dysregulated shared genes between smDEL and lgDEL datasets included EnrichR analysis and querying gnomAD.

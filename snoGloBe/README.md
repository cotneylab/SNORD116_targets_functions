Prediction of *SNORD116* binding on shared dysregulated genes with relevant controls using snoGloBe prediction tool. \
Following DESeq2 analysis, binding of SNORD116 on the 42 shared dysregulated genes was predicted using snoGloBe. \
SnoGloBe was developed by Dr. Michelle Scott's lab. For more information, please see their GitHub (https://github.com/scottgroup/snoGloBe). \

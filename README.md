Scripts for processing and analyzing data associated with “Identifying key underlying regulatory networks and predicting targets of orphan C/D box SNORD116 snoRNAs in Prader-Willi syndrome.” Raw sequencing data is available through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), assession GSE232183.

First, bulk RNA-Seq analysis was performed, followed by snoRNA prediction using snoGloBe.

All scripts are tailored for use on the UConn Health Xanadu Computing cluster which uses Slurm job scheduling system.
